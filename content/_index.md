# Rachel Salamatian, PhD

I'm a psychologist studying identity development, social perception, and the ways people navigate social identities in everyday life. My work combines cultural psychology with computational methods (e.g., topic modeling, semantic similarity, sentiment mapping) to understand how individuals describe themselves and how they perceive others.
