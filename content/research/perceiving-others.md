# Understanding Interpersonal Stereotypes around Social Identities

This program examines how people infer traits and belonging from social category information, and how stereotypes are structured and activated.

## Current Projects

1. **Race and gender**
2. **Ethnoracial ambiguity**
3. **Socioeconomic status**
4. **Political affiliation and religiosity**

### Project 1 — Race and Gender in Impression Formation


This project investigates how stereotypes emerge at the intersection of race and gender, and how perceivers map traits onto social category combinations. We use representational similarity analysis to model how stereotypes cluster across social identity groupings *(see Figure 1)*.

**Key idea:** Intersectional impressions are not additive—stereotype structure reflects emergent meaning.

### Project 2 — Ethnoracial Ambiguity

This project examines how ambiguity shapes categorization and downstream trait inference. We study how perceivers resolve uncertainty and how ambiguity affects perceived warmth, competence, and belonging *(see Figure 2)*.

**Key idea:** Ambiguity is not "absence of category"—it is a cue that changes inference.

### Project 3 — Socioeconomic Status

This project focuses on SES-based stereotypes and how class signals are integrated into impression formation. We test pathways from identity cues → trait inference → social distance *(see Figure 3)*.

**Key idea:** SES stereotypes shape both moral judgments and interpersonal closeness.

## Project 4 — Political Affiliation & Religiosity

This line of work investigates political and religious identities as perception filters—especially how they structure moral judgments, trust, and assumptions of worldview conflict. We test how ideological cues shift interpersonal evaluations *(see Figure 4)*.
