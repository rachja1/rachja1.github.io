# Mapping U.S. Regions & Cultural Pockets

This in-progress project explores how regional identity is psychologically represented and where meaning clusters geographically.

## Current Questions
- Where do “cultural pockets” emerge?
- How do people describe regional belonging?
- How do regional self-concepts relate to class, identity, and mobility?
