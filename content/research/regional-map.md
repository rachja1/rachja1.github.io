## Mapping U.S. Regions & Cultural Pockets

<div class="research-intro">

This in-progress project will explore how attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors are regionally represented and whether acculturation patterns geographically cluster. Cultural spillover refers to the outward diffusion of immigrant-origin practices, symbols, and values into the public and institutional fabric of a neighborhood that shapes the everyday environment of immigrants and non-immigrants.

### Current Questions
1. In what ways do immigrant-origin cultural markers become embedded in the broader neighborhood landscape? 
2. How far do cultural spillovers spread for different community types, and what predicts their diffusion?
3. Under what social and political conditions are cultural spillovers amplified or constrained?
   Does sociopolitical climate (e.g., anti-immigrant attitudes, political polarization) moderate the relationship between immigrant presence and cultural diffusion?

  <div class="figcaption">Community-type classification of immigrant-dense U.S. cities (≥30% immigrant residents). Cities are color-coded as corridors (high-diversity areas connected to other high-diversity neighbors), islands (high-diversity areas surrounded by low-diversity neighbors), edges (high-diversity areas adjacent to a mix of high- and low-diversity neighbors), and isolated cities with no adjacent neighbors (typically rural). The map highlights whether immigrant-dense communities are embedded in broader diversity networks or isolated within more homogeneous regions.</div>
