### Teaching

I've taught and supported undergraduate courses at the University of Oregon (2021–2025), with experience spanning statistics and statistical programming, cultural psychology, and core areas of psychological science. I value teaching that builds conceptual understanding, applied skills, and confidence, especially in quantitative methods.

## Teaching Fellow

**University of Oregon**

I was a Teaching Fellow for undergraduate courses in Statistics & Statistical Programming, Cultural Psychology, and Mind & Society. I led three instructional labs per term for statistics and statistical programming (weekly), with hands-on support in Jamovi and quantitative reasoning. I also supervised discussions in cultural psychology and related courses, supporting term papers, essay writing, and research-based argumentation.
